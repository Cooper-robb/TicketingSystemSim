<h3>Setup of Ticketing System</h3>
<p align="center">
To start I created an organization, I named it "Admin". When creating the organization I setup an email for end users they can email to put in a ticket. The email for my organization is "help@practice**.on.spiceworks.com":  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I then went in my owner account and added a new employee named "Paul Smith" and gave him a title to be able to handle the tickets that are submitted.:  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Using my end user account named "cooper robb", I emailed the organization's help desk to submit a ticket about a keyboard issue. The ticket submission then put me into the organizations user management system:  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Ticket Management</h2>
<p align="center">
Once the ticket was submitted, I logged into the account of Paul Smith. In my tickets tab I can see the ticket is unassigned, I accepted the ticket responsibilities and am now the working team member on that ticket:  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Within the ticket window, I changed the priority to low, set a due date as to when we wished to have the issue resolved, and added a category as to what the ticket is concerning:  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
After changing the attributes of the ticket, I responded to our end user letting them know that a member of the IT team would be around to help fix the issue they were having. after working on the ticket for 15+ minutes we had resolved the issue. An internal note was made (only visible to the IT team) that we troubleshooted the issue but ultimately replaced the keyboard. After documenting that ticket was resolved, I closed the ticket.:  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If we go back to our end users email account we can see two messages from our IT team. The first being our response that a member will come work on the issue and the second being that the ticket is closed:  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Dashboard View</h2>
Using the dashboard allows for a centralized view of all the tickets we have as an organization. After submitting numerous amount of various tickets from my end user account, I can see how many unassigned tickets, open/closed tickets, and tickets that are assigned to each member all in one place. A breakdown of the categories that are submitted the most allows us to see which ares of our organization are being reported the most. :  <br/>
